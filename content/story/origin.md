Siur was alone.

She was born to a large farming family, with pets and people everywhere, but now there was no one.
You see, one spring morning, a warlord came and took it all away.
Early that morning, 15-year-old Siur had been sent to a neighboring village to pick up some supplies. 
While gathering her belongings to return home, the attack happened.
She had no idea until she got home.
Only a crater remained.

So on this Spring morning, three years later, she sat alone under a slight, but shady tree on the outskirts of that same village.
After the tragedy, everyone had sent their condolences, but no one would give any help.
Not only had she lost her family, but she had lost all purpose.

She often thought, "Why me? Why wasn't I home?"
Not that she could have done anything.

But on this particular morning, her spirits were somewhat higher.
She thought about the stories her father had told her of the far off realms and the incredible grandeur.
Dreams of riches and happiness beyond her wildest dreams: palaces and gardens and family.
Tales from her mother of fairies and fortresses.

As she was deep in her thoughts, she wished for a friend to be with her.
Perhaps a dog - a pet that would love her unconditionally.
Maybe a cat - a creature to play with that could purr in delight.
A bird - one that would have freedom to fly and sweet songs to share.

Then her mind went to some mix of everything she desired in a companion. 
It would need to be smart, and kind, and free and special.
She invented a being that had a bit of everything. 
A strange dog-cat-hybrid, that also had wings for the flight of it.
Wouldn't this be her best friend, something to call family?

Then she remembered something her sister Thair had told her, of the magicians of the east.
They would often conjure creations, things that no one had seen, for the entertainment of their rulers.
If they could create such beings for frivolous purposes, then why shouldn't Siur be able to do the same?
After all, she knew she had a noble desire.

So she focused her thoughts, and dug deep inside her.
She followed the blueprint she had planned, and intended for the creature to appear.

* needs more effort...

After some effort, a ball of fur appeared in front of her.
From that fur, emerged a head and arms and legs.
These limbs were not human limbs, but more like cat paws, but with opposable thumbs.
The head was more human, though it was reminiscent of a dog.
Finally, wings emerged from its back, and it began to stretch.

Siur collapsed on the ground, exhausted from the effort she used.
As the world darkened around her, the creature exclaimed, "You're not well! I'll go get help." and scampered into the village.

Siur was no longer alone.
