The biological processes of reproduction and birth combine elements of *Origin* and *Tweak*. 

*Tweak* is used to arrange the biological elements, but the person does not become complete without *Origin* placing the soul or center of the being and attaching it to the rest of the matter. 

Importantly, this does not mean that something has to die, or lose its soul in the other realm, but rather some amount of disorganized matter is organized upon transition from the other realm. **This statement is still an open question**.
