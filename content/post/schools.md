In this as yet unnamed universe, there 3 of schools magic. They are as follows:

1. Origination - or "Origin" for short, creative magic
2. Suppression - or "Quell" for short, destructive magic
3. Transformation - or "Tweak" for short, manipulative magic

Each kind of magic follows some rules of conservation of energy, mass, or magic, but depend on the introduction of two *realms* or states of being so that any kind of energy, mass or other material property can exist in either *realm* and has a sort of parallel void in the inverse realm. Things that happen in one realm may affect the other in unexpected ways.

#### Origin
*Origin* magic is concerned with creating new things. These powers create something in the "present" realm by taking the necessary components from the "exiled" or "denied" realm. 

This means that in order to use creative magic, a being affects things beyond their own plane of existence, often with consequences that are not fully understood.

#### Quell
Similar to *Origin*, *Quell* operates by suppressing something, whether in whole or part, from the user's realm or plane into the "exiled" or "denied" realm.

*Quell* and *Origin* are inverses of each other, and if someone practices *Quell* in the "exiled" realm, it appears as *Origin* to the "present" realm.

#### Tweak
This magic works by transforming something in the current realm into something else. In contrast to *Origin* and *Quell*, *Tweak* is able to affect things in the current realm without causing reactions in the opposite realm.

When using particular kinds of Tweak magic, it is possible to affect the opposite realm, though these effects are often small in magnitude.
